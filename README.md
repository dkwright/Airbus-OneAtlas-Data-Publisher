# Airbus-OneAtlas-Data-Publisher
The Airbus OneAtlas Data Publisher is a custom Toolbox used in ArcGIS Pro. The toolbox automates download, decompression, and publishing of products ordered through OneAtlas Data. Decompression, and publishing steps are optional, supporting the creation of Hosted Imagery Layers using ArcGIS Image for ArcGIS Online. Hosted Imagery Layers provide a rich set of capabilities including streaming in support of 2D and 3D visualization, custom band composites, stretch, classification, and extensive support for analysis.
Details on the requirements, setup, and operation of these tools is covered in detail in the documentation https://github.com/dkwright/Airbus-OneAtlas-Data-Publisher/blob/main/documentation/Airbus%20OneAtlas%20Data%20Publisher%20User%20Guide.pdf
